# base

This is a simple repository for setting up the gem5-gpu repos.

This directory should contain gem5/, gem5-gpu/, and gpgpu-sim/.
gpgpu-sim/ may be a link to gpgpu-sim_distribution/src.

Run the script setup_repos.sh to set up all of the repos and checkout the correct branches (gem5-gpu for gem5 and gpgpu-sim).
